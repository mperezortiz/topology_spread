This repository includes two folders: 
  * Results: Folder including two csv files with the 30 computed network metrics and simulation results for more than 9000 social graphs. 
  * Code: Folder including the code to generate the network metrics and run the simulations. The code relies on a modified version of the simulator in https://github.com/ryansmcgee/seirsplus. The code uses static paths so please make sure to change those before running it! There are a few example scripts to run the code (some of which use parallelization).
